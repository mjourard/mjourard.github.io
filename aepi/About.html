            <span class="title">What is Alpha Epsilon Pi?</span>
            <p>Alpha Epsilon Pi provides an opportunity for a Jewish man to be able to join a Jewish organization whose
                purpose is not specifically religious, but rather social and cultural in nature. Alpha Epsilon Pi is a
                Jewish fraternity which focuses on developing young leaders while instilling a sense of brotherhood. It
                provides a home away from home while nurturing the core values that make a mensch, a mensch. It also
                serves as a link between generations, providing opportunities for young men to join the skilled work
                force.</p>

            <span class="title">Why did I join?</span>
            <p>In the final months of high school, my mind wasn't in a great place. I had just broken up with my first long-term girlfriend, I couldn't keep my part-time job because I was moving cities, the youth group I was a part of (NFTY-NEL) is for high schoolers and youth soccer was over for me. It felt like I was losing big parts of my life all at once, and I felt empty.</p>
            <p>I was contacted by a two members of the Guelph chapter of AEPi. They gave me their shpiel of what AEPi is and since I was looking for a new group of friends as well as a new community to be a part of, the choice to rush was obvious.</p>
            <p>Five years later, I'm an active member of the chapter, keeping in contact with Alumni while providing insight into chapter affairs for the younger leaders.</p>

            <span class="title">What do I do in Alpha Epsilon Pi?</span>
            <p>I've held a few leadership positions during my tenure here. I was on the executive board as Sentinel in my first year. I was on the Rush committee in my third year. In fourth year, I helped plan our Bar Mitzvah celebration party. At that same party, I won the "Most Improved Brother" award, for my dramatically increased presence that year.</p>
            <p>In my fifth year, I've elected to take a step back from leadership to focus on school. That being said, I'm still making an effort to attend every event I can, while offering words of wisdom and encouragement where it's needed.</p>
