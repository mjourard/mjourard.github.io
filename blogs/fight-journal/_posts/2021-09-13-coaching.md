This session was rescheduled to be after a morning cardio class due to a dentist appointment at my regular time.

* when roundhouse kicking, able to use the movement after kick while leg is still in the air to **AGGRESSIVELY** cut an angle into the person


* I have a tendency to:
  * cut left
  * uppercut w/ right
  * knee w/ right

I must remember to work in the other directions/striking appendanges, don't want to have an unbalanced offense. 

* I'm doing a weird flinch where I drop into a 1/8 squat.
  * Suspected cause: not expecting to get hit
  * **ALWAYS** expect to get hit
  * POST LESSON NOTE: Tried implementing that note at the following lesson and it seemed to work well. I for the most part was able to dodge the hooks, even with the smaller pads. 

### Notes on First Sparring Session
* Clinching requires setup. If you fail the grab, abandon it and try to setup again
  * forcing a failed grab just ends up pushing the opponent around and wasting energy
* Big Combo: Orthodox Roundhouse kick -> aggressive cut that changes stance to South Paw -> Left Roundhouse Kick
* Push kicks: I thought I was maybe being too harsh with them since they were applauded by two people. Feedback - they were fine, and the fact that they were commented on is a good thing. I'm not hitting too hard with them.
