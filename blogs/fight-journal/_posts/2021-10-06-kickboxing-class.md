A simple class tonight focusing on footwork again. 
It's starting to come together and I don't feel like the odd one out during class anymore in terms of either technical ability or fitness.

Two quick things of note:
* got kicked in the head twice (with question mark kicks). Wolf said that was one too many
  * need to remember to keep my hands up for defense
* getting pretty winded with my mouth guard in again. Wasn't exhaling as much as I should have been. Likely was just me not being used to it again

Overall, good class, seeing progress!
