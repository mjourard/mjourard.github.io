Looks like I was still ducking on rhythm instead of by a reaction. Need to focus on that.
I need to remember to expect to get hit, it should help with ducking fast enough.

The other thing was I didn't move out of danger fast enough. It was a pattern 
that Jim had where he'd move closer during the hooks and as I came up, I was too close to jab-cross effectively.
