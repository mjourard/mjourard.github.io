The drill tonight was very similar to Wednesday's drill. 
The biggest difference tonight was that we were ducking under a swing from our opponent during the back-leg crossover. 

Some things that Wolf repeated in the class:
* your body being close to the opponent during the transition as well as properly positioned to the side is what protects you
* Make sure you aren't starring at the ground, but also keep your chin down
* Look at the opponent during the transition, not off to where you're going

Personal notes:
* Wolf: I shouldn't drop my head as low as I was sometimes
* Wolf: It doesn't have to be just one punch. When your opponent hands you an opportunity to let loose, you take it
* Wolf [context: I was the punching bag doing the swinging]: actually move yourself into position while you're swinging, don't just stand there like a statue as you swing, it's not useful to me or my partner
  * self note: it did feel weird at the time, I should listen to my body and try to fix it on my own
* Me: Migel was very good at hitting points that actually mattered where as I both wasn't throwing very effective punches and I couldn't hit his exposed stomach and obliques very well
  * Not sure if it's a case of me not knowing how to hit properly or him having better defense.
