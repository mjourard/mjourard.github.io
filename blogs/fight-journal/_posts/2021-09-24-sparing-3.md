First boxing sparring, let's see how it goes.

Goals for today:
1. Don't get rocked in the head
   1. accomplished by keeping my guard up, and my straight punches crisp and coming back to my cheek
   2. ensure I don't give the opponening for hooks
2. try to use the cross-over steps taught this week in classes
   1. TODO: link back to the notes here
3. when facing Denis, remember not to treat his outstretched guard as a target, but something to get around
