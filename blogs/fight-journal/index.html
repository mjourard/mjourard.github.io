title: Fight Journal

p1: A journal of notes I make after boxing and kickboxing classes, as well as after sparring sessions. This is more for me than actually useful content for others.
p2: The titles are just going to be what the notes are from with the date. If there's a big event I might title the post differently, but I don't foresee that happening.
