            <p>Trans Plus is a software company specializing in Windows-based transportation software that was founded in Guelph. They have a flagship program called ‘Fleet Manager’ that is used by trucking companies to manage the logistics of their truck fleets. As a development company, they utilize the scrum methodology to push out new features in a timely manner.</p>
            <p>Adknown is a high-performance advertiser that was founded in Guelph. Their business model is to bid on web traffic from different exchanges where a user is most likely to click on the ad we are serving.</p>

            <p>Upon joining the development team at Adknown, I was tasked with managing the development of the Mobile RTB project. This project contained the tech for placing bids on internet traffic and logging the results of placing those bids. </p>
            <p>As the development manager of the project, I oversaw everything from the development of new features to managing the servers that the code ran from and deploying code once it was finished development. Monitoring and maintaining the bid and log stack fall under my responsibilities as well. It was a big step for someone with minimal prior web development experience, but my boss and the rest of the team were always happy to offer input on any issues I would face. </p>
            <p>While working on Mobile RTB, I was exposed to a ton of different technologies. The bid and log stack are both written in PHP (was 5.6, now 7 after I upgraded them). I hadn’t worked with PHP since high school but this was a very good demonstration of both the computational and development power of PHP. Seriously, it’s a great language that I wish I had more time to talk about, but that’s for another post. </p>
            <p>The next “big” technology I got to see and use was ‘redis’. Redis is a service that allows you to store different types of data in memory that would then be associated with a key. Think ‘giant data bank’. It stores five different data types: strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. We use lists to store data that requires processing received from exchanges to be later processed. We use hashes for lightning fast lookups of bidding logic for if we want to bid on some ad space or not. Redis allows us to keep our response times to exchanges very fast, as there is no searching multiple rows like there would be with SQL. Most practical methods in redis have a complexity of O(1). </p>
            <p>The last piece of tech I’d like to talk about is called ‘FluentD’. It is described as a ‘unified logging layer’ and it allows you to take in log files, manipulate the logs however you want (i.e. add a field, change how they’re separated, etc.)  and then output them to another source. We use this to log our responses to exchanges for if we decided to bid or not on some ad traffic, as well as if we win when we bid. It makes modifying what we log very easy, since it usually means adding an additional parameter to a configuration file, as well as a spot in the code that creates the object that pushes to fluentD. </p>
            <p>I suppose it’s also worth mentioning that the entire Mobile RTB uses the Amazon Web Services platform. We keep our bidding servers on auto-scaling ec2 instances, our adhoc log data in a sql database on an RDS instance, our long-term data is stored in Simple Storage Server (S3) and we’re now getting into using redshift for running queries on our long term data. The AWS platform is infinitely scalable and after using it for the short 4 months I’ve worked at Adknown, I’m hooked. </p>

                <goalTitle>Create Automatic Testing Script For Bid Servers</goalTitle>
                <p>When I first joined the Mobile RTB project, the bid server code was in a working state, however making changes to it was very scary because there were something like 50 different possible cases that could happen when a bid request comes through and I had no way of knowing if I was hitting every one. To alleviate that stress, I built a test harness for the bid server code that covered almost 100% of the code. Now the test harness is run whenever the production code for the bid server is released.</p>
            </goal>
            <goal>
                <goalTitle>Complete All Outstanding Tickets For Mobile RTB</goalTitle>
                <p>As with most projects, there were some outstanding tasks left from my predecessor. They weren’t too bad, but I completed them all and now the outstanding work is the new features to be released. </p>
            </goal>
            <goal>
                <goalTitle>Organize and Automate the Alert System of MobileRTB</goalTitle>
                <p> The Mobile RTB system had many alerts for when things break, however some of the older processes don’t have the alerts. I added the alerts and now the system is much more automated.</p>
