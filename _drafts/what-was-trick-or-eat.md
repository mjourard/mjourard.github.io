* blurb about the food insecurity problem in Canada


* blurb about Meal Exchange and the Trick or Eat event

Meal Exchange is a nationally-recognized Canadian non-profit charity which coordinates student volunteers on university campuses in an effort to fight food insecurity across Canada. 
Meal Exchange supports community-driven solutions such as food banks, campus kitchens, gardens and farms. 
They also provide mentorship and resources, connect students with their peers across the country, and provide a single point of contact for provincial and national stakeholders in business, civil society and media.

Trick or Eat is Meal Exchange's Halloween food drive, in which student volunteers go door-to-door on Halloween collecting non-perishable food to give to a local food bank.

While the event is a fun time and was extremely effective at Guelph (TODO: find total amount of food raised in final years and put here), it was always a hectic start.
The following had to happen in order for someone to participate in the event:
1. They'd sign a waiver. Liability release for things the usual off-campus school activities
2. They'd join a team, typically in tandom with their teammates
3. Their team would be assigned a collection route and bus number, which they'd receive on an already printed-out sheet of paper. 
The route was a residential route they'd walk with a shopping cart and their team, knocking on the doors of all the houses on the route and collecting generous donations from the residents.
The bus was a chartered school bus that would take them to the drop-off point of their "zone" (a collection of routes with a central pick-up and drop-off point)
    a. Note: All of these houses had flyers delivered with opt-out information delivered to them at least 2 weeks in advance by event volunteers
4. They'd sit around for ~20 minutes and wait for their bus to start boarding, as notified by event staff via megaphone.
5. Once the bus finished boarding, it departs for their dropoff location, in which they complete their route and return to pickup location with their shopping cart full of non-perishable food items.

Each of the above steps is very chaotic when done in a relatively small, loud space with the medium of information transfer being paper. The Trick or Eat app was intended to make running the event easier,
while also ensuring information transfer from year to year was made easier.

Year to year information transfer means all of the following:
1. Contacting participants from previous years
2. Passing along route information
    a. the actual route itself
    b. amount of food collected in each route
    c. any issues with the route to be fixed or avoided next year
3. Collected participant feedback

So, sponsored development through a grant was kicked off in 2015(?)
